# Pandas-CSS-Grid-System
###### I have tried many grid systems or grid frameworks. Many were too big or too confusing. That's exactly why I wrote my own CSS Grid. It is minimalistic, super simple and has only the most important functions.

### Introduction
12 Columns
My standard grid has 12 columns. No matter the size of the browser, each of these columns will always have an equal width.
`
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s1">1</div>
    <div class="col s1">2</div>
    <div class="col s1">3</div>
    <div class="col s1">4</div>
    <div class="col s1">5</div>
    <div class="col s1">6</div>
    <div class="col s1">7</div>
    <div class="col s1">8</div>
    <div class="col s1">9</div>
    <div class="col s1">10</div>
    <div class="col s1">11</div>
    <div class="col s1">12</div>
  </div>

### Container
The container class is not strictly part of the grid but is important in laying out content. It allows you to center your page content. The container class is set to 70%-90% of the window width. It helps you center and contain your page content. I use the container to contain my body content.

To add a container just put your content inside a <div> tag with a container class. Here's an example of how your page might be set up.

`
  <div class="container">
    <!-- Page Content goes here -->
  </div>
`
